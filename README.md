# Playing with Lottie - Animation Library

> This was created during my [quarantine challenges](https://github.com/chrishoste/quarantine-challenge). Check out the more stuff I did during this time.

## Challenge
I always wanted to try out [Lottie from airbnb](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/). Now I finally did it and made my own `mini` animation with Illustrator (AI) and After Effects (AE). Check it out on [Lottiefiels](https://lottiefiles.com/share/8GgtAc).
